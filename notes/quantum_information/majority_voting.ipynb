    "A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_symmetric_channel\">binary symmetric channel</a> (or BSCp) is a common communications channel model used in coding theory and information theory. In this model, a transmitter wishes to send a bit (a zero or a one), and the receiver will receive a bit. The bit will be \"flipped\" with a crossover probability of $p$, and received correctly with probability $1-p$. This model can be applied to varied communication channels such as telephone lines or disk drive storage [2].\n",
