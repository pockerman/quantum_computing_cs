    "<a href=\"#\">Quantum entanglement</a> is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a pair or group of particles is generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each particle of the pair or group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics lacking in classical mechanics [2]."

    "Classical mechanics assumes that complex systems can be fully understood if we are able to understand their constituents [1]. This is not necessarily true for quantum systems. Let's see this with the following example from [1]. Let's consider a non-trivial two-particle system. Each particle is allowed to occupy only two points $(x_0, x_1)$ and $(y_0, y_1)$. The quantum system can have the following superimposed state vector"
