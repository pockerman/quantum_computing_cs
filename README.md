This is my set of notes for learning quantum computing. These notes have been produced using a variety of sources. However, the main references used are


1. Noson Y. Yanofsky, Mirco A. Mannucci, ```Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists```, Cambridge University Press.
2. Michael A. Nielsen, Isaac L. Chuang. ```Quantum Computation and Quantum Information```, Cambridge University Press.
3. Jack D. Hidary, ```Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach```, Springer.
4. Eleanor Rieffel, Wolfgang Polak, ```Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction```, The MIT Press.

Primarily, these notes follow the first book and use other sources for further explaining points and/or fill missing details.
I use Python to both solve the exercises as well as the examples in the first book.

**Remark**

Note that this is work in progress. Although I try to give the credit needed, I may miss some points. 
This is not done deliberately. Let me know if you identify places where your work has not been properly acknowledged.

## Building ```jupyter-book```

Assuming that you have <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html">jupyter-book</a> installed you can generate
and html version of the notebooks by issuing on the top level directory the following

```
jupyter-book build notes/
```

The command above will create a ```notebooks/_build``` directory.  Note that you make have to copy the ```imgs/``` into the  
```notebooks/_build```
