This is my set of notes for learning quantum programming. These notes have been produced using a variety of sources. However, the main references used are


1. Noson Y. Yanofsky, Mirco A. Mannucci, ```Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists```, Cambridge University Press.
2. Michael A. Nielsen, Isaac L. Chuang. ```Quantum Computation and Quantum Information```, Cambridge University Press.

Primarily, these notes follow the first book and use other sources for further explaining points and/or fill missing details.
I use Python to both solve the exercises as well as the examples in the first book.

**Remark**

Note that this is work in progress. Although I try to give the credit needed, I may miss some points. 
This is not done deliberately. Let me know if you identify places where your work has not been properly acknowledged.
